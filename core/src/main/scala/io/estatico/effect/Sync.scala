/**
 * Type class for effects which support synchronous execution.
 *
 * For types F which are also an Applicative, this provides something similar to
 * Applicative#point, the difference being that Sync.now will create a new
 * synchronous effect instead of running the effect asynchronously, which is
 * generally what point does. From the standpoint of async operations, the Sync
 * type class can be an optimization to avoid spinning up new threads where unnecessary.
